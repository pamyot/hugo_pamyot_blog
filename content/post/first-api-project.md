The start of my exploration on API's.

## Why?

The objective of the exercise is to better understand the different issues surrounding the implementation of modern solutions based on a deployable cloud API architecture.

## Platform selection

Many platforms exist, see [API Evangelist - August 2015](http://deployment.apievangelist.com/guide/api-evangelist-api-deployment-industry-guide-august-2015.pdf)

To limit the choice, I'll select the platform based on some personal criteria :

1. Available in open source on [Github](https://github.com/)
2. [BaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_backend_as_a_service) platform or compatible with a BaaS
3. [Fullstack Javascript](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/11/introduction-to-full-stack-javascript/)
4. Stable release [Github - Release](https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software)

## Finalists

I retain the following platforms in my initial experimentation :

1. [apigee](http://apigee.com/about/developers) via [a127](https://github.com/apigee-127/a127-documentation/wiki/Quick-start)
2. [LoopBack](http://loopback.io/)
3. [sails](http://sailsjs.org/)
4. [restify](http://restify.com/)

## My personal setup

To build my first projet, I will use the Microsoft [code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) editor on an [Asus UX305C](http://myzen.asus.com/2015/10/29/an-update-to-the-asus-zenbook-ux305/) portable computer.  Occasionally, I use [c9](https://c9.io) order to have a fully available cloud development environment.

It's a start!
