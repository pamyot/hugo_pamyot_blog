## The history

In 2015, IBM as [bought](http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/47577.wss) [Strongloop](https://strongloop.com/), the company
 behind the [loopback.io](http://loopback.io/) API framework.
 
During the last months, I've been looking at all the framework and products that are available 
to build an API based solutions.  

Some framework/products are Opensource (ex: [OpenAPI](https://openapis.org/), [restify](http://restify.com/) and [Feathers](https://www.gitbook.com/book/feathersjs/feathers-docs/details)),
others not (ex: [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/api-gateway/)) and many are in between (ex: [Apigee](http://apigee.com/about/), [Strongloop](https://strongloop.com/)).

As a developer, I see a big advantage in using an opensource framework and I don't want a vendor lock-in
during the lifespan of my solution.

A few days ago, I started my exploration on building my first API based software using only Opensource 
software.  Loopback as been my selected framework as it is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback)
and is released under a MIT license.

## Why an IBM publicity on the front page of the loopback framework ?

This morning I had a big surprise when I visited the [loopback.io](http://loopback.io/) home page : 

{{% fluid_img "/img/api-loopback/loopback-ibm-api-pub.png" %}}

Yes, it is a **big IBM publicity** for the new IBM API connect!  How is that possible ?
The reason is really simple, while the software is released under a MIT license, all the major contributors
building the framework are working for the Strongloop/IBM corporation.

## What will be the future of the loopback framework ?

I don't want to guess if the framework will work at full capacity when it is hosted on [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/),
 [Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/) and not the [IBM Bluemix](http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/)
 cloud solution.
 
Only the future can tell, am I right to be afraid ?
